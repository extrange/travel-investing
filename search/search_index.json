In other words, there will no longer be any riders covering 100% of your hospital bills. Part of the blame was laid upon increasing healthcare expenses and 'buffet syndrome' , but that is also debatable . With this in mind, I decided to look at the Great Eastern's (GE) new riders . Great Eastern offers 2 classes of riders on top of their base shield plan (GREAT SupremeHealth). These are called GREAT TotalCare Classic and Elite . They are available for all classes of the base shield plan, from B1 wards all the way to private hospitals 3 . Medishield Life \u00b6 ISPs and Medishield Life, the compulsory national health insurance we all have, require one to co-pay part of the bill, depending on the size. This is known as 'co-insurance'. There is also a minimum amount you must pay on the base plan. This is the deductible 1 , and is independent of the bill size 2 . The main purpose of GE's riders is to cover the co-insurance amount and the deductible. Before 2 Apr, riders could cover 100% of this amount. Now, consumers must co-pay at least 5% of the total bill. How do they differ? \u00b6 Let's start by looking at the similarities. In terms of the special benefits such as ambulance services, home health care benefit and limits on payable benefit, they are identical across their classes. There is no difference here - a TotalCare Classic-P and an Elite-P plan have the exact same special benefits. So what's the difference? It's in how much co-payment they cover. B1 and A rider comparison \u00b6 These plans cover B1 to A class wards in restructured hospitals. The Classic-A and B plans (the lower tier ones) require you to pay the greater of $3000 4 or 5% of the total bill. In contrast, the Elite-A and B plans require you to pay only 5% of the total bill, regardless of the size. Bill Size (B1 to A) $10,000 $60,000 $100,000 TotalCare Classic $3,000 $3,000 $5,000 TotalCare Elite $500 $3,000 $5,000 For a large bill 5 , you'll pay the same amount. For smaller bills however, you'll co-pay less with the Elite plan. Private rider comparison \u00b6 The situation is slightly different for the private riders. Here, you'll fall into one of the two groups 7 : Group 1: Restructured hospitals and private hospitals with a certificate of pre-authorization 8 (only applicable for panel doctors) Group 2: Private hospitals without a certificate of pre-authorization If you fall into the first group, the Classic-P and Elite-P plans are identical - you only pay 5% of the total bill. Things are different if you are in the second group (without pre-authorization). On the Classic-P plan, you'd have to pay the greater of 5% of the total bill, or the deductible from the base plan (currently $3,500 for people younger than 80 years). On the Elite-P plan however, you only pay 5% of the total bill again. Bill Size (Private) $10,000 $70,000 $100,000 TotalCare Classic $3,000 $3,500 $5,000 TotalCare Elite $500 $3,500 $5,000 Again, for a large bill 6 , you'll pay the same amount, while for smaller bills, the Elite plan covers more. So should we get the Elite plan, since the coverage is more? Let's compare the prices of these plans. Cost comparison \u00b6 Extra coverage must come at a price. We can make some observations: The P- (or private) class of either plan is markedly more expensive than the A- or B- ones. The Elite plan is markedly more expensive than the Classic plan For example, at 35 years, you'd be paying $377 more or 2.1x At 70 years, you'd be paying $2,796 more or 2.5x We can also look at the total premiums one would pay for different lengths of time: Total Premiums Paid Classic-P Elite-P Difference 20 to 50 years $11,420 $24,982 $13,562 20 to 74 years $43,872 $103,420 $59,548 One might ask how often must each individual be hospitalized, to receive benefits exceeding the premium paid, over the period of 30 years? This is not easy to calculate. We would need to take the average hospital bill size, as well as the hospitalization rates for an individual, and then run them through a spreadsheet. (Work in progress) Note also, that GE has introduced a claims-based pricing mechanic. I won't go into detail here, but suffice to say, your premiums increase the more times you are admitted, up to 2.5x the standard amount. Which plan is better? \u00b6 This question is subjective, since people have different needs. For the Classic plan: You pay less premiums overall For private hospitals, if you get a certificate of pre-authorization (i.e. a panel doctor), you pay the same as someone on the Elite plan However, for B1 to A wards, you have to pay the greater of 5% or the deductible (~$3,500) And for private hospitals, if you don't have a certificate of pre-authorization, you'll have to pay the greater of 5% or the deductible The Elite plan: You pay only 5% of the total bill regardless of pre-authorization or ward class However, the total premium paid is much higher than the Classic (up to $60,000 ) I feel that the real question is - would you pay $60,000 extra, to always pay only 5% of the total bill, regardless of the size? My opinion is that the Elite plan will in a sense 'pay-off' if you get warded frequently in private hospitals. Otherwise, you would be better off using the $60,000 that you would have saved, to pay for the excesses under the Classic plan. Even if you end up co-paying $3000 each admission, you'd have to be warded 20 times from 20 to 74 years of age to end up paying more than what someone with the Elite plan would have paid. Which, based on statistics , is unlikely. Therefore, the Classic plan looks like the winner here. As always, I'm open to comments and feedback! Written on 18/6/21 by Nicholas The deductible for GREAT SupremeHealth, for a private ward, is currently $3,500. This means that you'll have to pay the first $3,500 of your hospital bill (plus co-insurance), before any coverage happens. \u21a9 It does change by age and ward class, however. For example, a 50 year old in a private ward has a deductible of $3,500, but an 86 year old in a private ward has a deductible of $5,250. \u21a9 The TotalCare rider plan class must match the base SupremeHealth plan class, i.e. if you have a SupremeHealth A Plus plan, you can only buy the TotalCare Classic-A or Elite-A rider plans. \u21a9 Of course, if your total bill is less than $3000, then that's what you'd pay! \u21a9 $60,000 is the point of indifference between the two riders for the B1 to A plans - at this amount, you'll pay the same for both plans and so no reason to favour one over the other. \u21a9 $70,000 is the amount, above which, you'll pay the same for both riders. \u21a9 This segregation exists because insurance companies think that non-panel doctors charge more, and hence are not eligible for pre-authorization. Whether this is true or not is a subject of intense debate . \u21a9 This is a certificate from the insurance company stating that they have reviewed your application to be warded at a private hospital at a higher coverage, only if you've chosen a panel doctor. It takes a few working days, so it's not applicable if say, you have an emergency and get warded at a private hospital - there'd be no way for you to get the certificate in time. \u21a9","title":"GE TotalCare Rider Comparison"},{"location":"posts/insurance/2021-06-18-ge-totalcare-comparison/#a-comparison-between-great-easterns-totalcare-classic-and-elite-riders","text":"On 2 Apr 2021, MOH announced that all new and existing Integrated Shield Plans (ISPs) would need to integrate a 5% co-payment feature.

Later, when premiums get more expensive, switch to the lower tier riders 2 . I also agree with your paradigm: It is the author\u2019s recommendation to adopt the following paradigm: Highest tier, and highest coverage while young. Downgrade as necessary, when necessary, at a later age. Here, I argue specifically that you should keep a private hospital plan, plus a deluxe rider plan, when young. When you're older, downgrade the deluxe rider plan to a classic. Some caveats: I'm only going to compare private hospital coverage. Personally, I want the option to go to a private hospital, since queues at public hospitals can be unpredictable . Also, I want maximum coverage early on in life as I've stated above. I'm not going to comment on when the best age is to downgrade coverage, because that depends on a whole host of factors 3 which I might cover on another article. I'm not going to take into account cost differences between riders at the same level (e.g. NTUC's vs GE's deluxe riders). That difference is much less than between the classic and deluxe level for any company's riders (e.g., $60,000 in GE's case ). Why have a deluxe rider when you're young? \u00b6 When you're young, you're working. You have a stream of income. You can pay for that $600 GE Elite-P rider. If you get sick, you deserve the best. You don't want to have to pay a deductible of $3,500 each year when you get hospitalized, when you can just pay 5% of the total bill with riders. Things are different when you're older. Premiums are much, much higher . It might not make sense to pay a $10,000 premium just to save on a $3,500 deductible yearly. The cost difference between the deluxe and classic riders is less significant when you're younger (on the average of $400/year). When you're older though, it jumps to $1,000 and can reach $2,700 (GE Elite-P vs Classic-P at 70 years). And as you mentioned, you can't upgrade the rider if you develop a pre-existing condition. You can, however, downgrade the rider anytime. So, keep the deluxe rider when you're young. You don't pay much more than the classic, and the benefits are nice. Let's compare the classic-level riders next. Which is the best classic-level rider? \u00b6 First out, let me say NTUC's Classic Care Rider is the worst of the three. This is because: the additional $2,000 non-panel penalty is significant 10% co-pay is effectively double what both NTUC or GE's riders offer So, it's between GE or Prudential. GE's TotalCare Classic PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay Any cap? Panel 5% of total bill 5% of total bill + 50% of deductible Yes, $3000/year Non-Panel Greater of deductible 4 or 5% of total bill 5% of total bill + 50% of deductible No Just purely based on the math (see the note below): If you're seeing panel doctors - GE wins. It's just a flat 5% of the total bill, nothing else. If you're seeing non-panel doctors, and the bill is less than $38,500, Prudential wins. Otherwise, GE wins. I agree that PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay has a slightly longer non-panel pre- and post-hospitalization coverage, at 180 and 365 days respectively, versus that of GE's TotalCare Classic (120 and 180 days respectively). I also agree that Prudential pays as-charged for community hospital stays, while GE has daily limits (of around $200). GE has a nice 'home health care' benefit which can be used for home palliative care services (up to $10,000 or $200/day). PRUExtra Premier Lite Copay does not have claims-based pricing , while GE's TotalCare Classic has . GE's TotalCare Classic, however, has a 20% discount on premiums if no claim is made. These factors, combined, favour Prudential somewhat. Personally, it's a toss-up between both. I'd go with either. Now, we move on to the deluxe-level riders. The math behind the $38,500 figure Let \\(T\\) be the total hospital bill size and \\(D_{max}\\) be the maximum advertised deductible. The actual deductible paid is given as \\[\\begin{equation} min(T, D_{max}) \\end{equation}\\] For GE TotalCare Classic, the amount one would co-pay if they saw a non-panel doctor is the greater of the maximum deductible or 5% of the total bill, or: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{copay_ge} Copay_{GE} = max(min(T, D_{max}), 0.05\\cdot T) \\end{equation}\\] For PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay, one pays 50% of the deductible, followed by 50% of the coinsurance (10% of the amount remaining after the maximum deductible is subtracted). \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{deductible} \\text{50% of deductible} = 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{coinsurance} \\text{50% of coinsurance} = 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\end{equation}\\] since there is no co-insurance to pay if the total bill is less than the maximum deductible. By adding eqn. \\(\\ref{deductible}\\) and \\(\\ref{coinsurance}\\) we obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{copay_pru} Copay_{Prudential} = 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) + 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\end{equation}\\] Subtracting eqn. \\(\\ref{copay_ge}\\) from \\(\\ref{copay_pru}\\) , we obtain \\(\\Delta_{Prudential - GE}\\) , or the extra amount one would pay with Prudential versus GE: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{delta} \\begin{split} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE} &= Copay_{Prudential} - Copay_{GE} \\nonumber \\\\ &= 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) + 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\\\ &\\quad- max(min(T, D_{max}), 0.05\\cdot T) \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] If \\(\\Delta_{Prudential - GE} \\geq 0\\) , one would pay more for the Prudential plan, given a total bill size \\(T\\) . We simplify eqn. \\(\\ref{delta}\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{cases} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE}= \\begin{cases} -0.5\\cdot T,& \\text{if } T \\leq D_{max} \\\\ 0.05\\cdot T - 0.55\\cdot D_{max}, & \\text{if } T \\gt D_{max} \\text{ and } T \\lt 20\\cdot D_{max} \\\\ 0.45\\cdot D_{max} & \\text{if } T \\geq 20\\cdot D_{max} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Note that for the second case: \\[\\begin{equation} 0.05\\cdot T - 0.55\\cdot D_{max} \\gt 0 \\text{ when } T \\gt 11\\cdot D_{max} \\end{equation}\\] We can conclude that one would pay more for the Prudential plan when \\(T \\gt 11\\cdot D_{max}\\) . When \\(T \\lt 11\\cdot D_{max}\\) , one would pay less with the Prudential plan. Finally, for our case \\(D_{max} = 3500\\) , we obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{cases-3500} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE}= \\begin{cases} -0.5\\cdot T,& \\text{if } T \\leq 3500 \\\\ 0.05\\cdot T - 1925, & \\text{if } T \\gt 3500 \\text{ and } T \\lt 70000 \\\\ 1575 & \\text{if } T \\geq 20\\cdot D_{max} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Visually, Eqn. \\(\\ref{cases-3500}\\) can be plotted as follows: Which is the best deluxe-level rider? \u00b6 All 3 insurers here offer 5% co-payment riders here (although Prudential's PRUExtra Premier has an additional 5% of deductible). Of note, only NTUC does not explictly mention claims-based pricing. However, there is an 'additional non-panel payment' which is unspecified . I consider this a form of claims-based pricing. The actual penalty is unknown, and for this reason NTUC is out of the picture again. Prudential's claims-based pricing penalty is the most severe, with a 3x premium penalty if you claim more than $5000 from a non-panel provider. GE's penalty is 1.5x the premium as penalty if you claim more than $2000 for the first time. It increases up to 2.5x the premium subsequently. We now look at other factors. Of the three, Prudential has the longest pre- and post- hospitalization coverage of 180 and 365 days respectively. This is longer than GE's 120/180 days. GE has a nice 'home health care' benefit which I've mentioned above . I'd favour Prudential somewhat here, since the idea is to get as much coverage as possible for the deluxe-level rider. Conclusion \u00b6 It's a bit of a surprise to me (as I'm on a GE plan currently). The Prudential riders (specifically the PRUExtra Premier Lite and Premier) stand out above the rest, if only lightly. If you already have one of these deluxe riders and you're young, keep it - the differences aren't enough to justify switching and going through another 90-day no-claim period. If you're looking on the market for a rider - you might want to check out the Prudential riders. Written on 19/6/21 by Nicholas Aka deluxe level riders, such as GE's TotalCare Elite, or NTUC's Deluxe Rider. \u21a9 Aka classic level riders, such as GE's TotalCare Classic or PRUExtra Premier Lite. \u21a9 One might try to calculate the optimum age to downgrade. For example, you might take the probability of hospitalization at each year of life, multiply that by the median hospital bill size, and sum till different ages. The age at which the total costs of the deluxe-level rider begins to exceed the sum of the hospital bills is where one might decide to downgrade. This however, ignores the fact that the probability of hospitalization each year is not independent.

Later, when premiums get more expensive, switch to the lower tier riders 2 . I also agree with your paradigm: It is the author\u2019s recommendation to adopt the following paradigm: Highest tier, and highest coverage while young. Downgrade as necessary, when necessary, at a later age. Here, I argue specifically that you should keep a private hospital plan, plus a deluxe rider plan, when young. When you're older, downgrade the deluxe rider plan to a classic. Some caveats: I'm only going to compare private hospital coverage. Personally, I want the option to go to a private hospital, since queues at public hospitals can be unpredictable . Also, I want maximum coverage early on in life as I've stated above. I'm not going to comment on when the best age is to downgrade coverage, because that depends on a whole host of factors 3 which I might cover on another article. I'm not going to take into account cost differences between riders at the same level (e.g. NTUC's vs GE's deluxe riders). That difference is much less than between the classic and deluxe level for any company's riders (e.g., $60,000 in GE's case ).","title":"A comparison of shield plan riders (NTUC, GE, Prudential)"},{"location":"posts/insurance/2021-06-19-comparison-of-isp-riders/#why-have-a-deluxe-rider-when-youre-young","text":"When you're young, you're working. You have a stream of income. You can pay for that $600 GE Elite-P rider. If you get sick, you deserve the best. You don't want to have to pay a deductible of $3,500 each year when you get hospitalized, when you can just pay 5% of the total bill with riders. Things are different when you're older. Premiums are much, much higher . It might not make sense to pay a $10,000 premium just to save on a $3,500 deductible yearly. The cost difference between the deluxe and classic riders is less significant when you're younger (on the average of $400/year). When you're older though, it jumps to $1,000 and can reach $2,700 (GE Elite-P vs Classic-P at 70 years). And as you mentioned, you can't upgrade the rider if you develop a pre-existing condition. You can, however, downgrade the rider anytime. So, keep the deluxe rider when you're young. You don't pay much more than the classic, and the benefits are nice. Let's compare the classic-level riders next.","title":"Why have a deluxe rider when you're young?"},{"location":"posts/insurance/2021-06-19-comparison-of-isp-riders/#which-is-the-best-classic-level-rider","text":"First out, let me say NTUC's Classic Care Rider is the worst of the three. This is because: the additional $2,000 non-panel penalty is significant 10% co-pay is effectively double what both NTUC or GE's riders offer So, it's between GE or Prudential. GE's TotalCare Classic PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay Any cap? Panel 5% of total bill 5% of total bill + 50% of deductible Yes, $3000/year Non-Panel Greater of deductible 4 or 5% of total bill 5% of total bill + 50% of deductible No Just purely based on the math (see the note below): If you're seeing panel doctors - GE wins. It's just a flat 5% of the total bill, nothing else. If you're seeing non-panel doctors, and the bill is less than $38,500, Prudential wins. Otherwise, GE wins. I agree that PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay has a slightly longer non-panel pre- and post-hospitalization coverage, at 180 and 365 days respectively, versus that of GE's TotalCare Classic (120 and 180 days respectively). I also agree that Prudential pays as-charged for community hospital stays, while GE has daily limits (of around $200). GE has a nice 'home health care' benefit which can be used for home palliative care services (up to $10,000 or $200/day). PRUExtra Premier Lite Copay does not have claims-based pricing , while GE's TotalCare Classic has . GE's TotalCare Classic, however, has a 20% discount on premiums if no claim is made. These factors, combined, favour Prudential somewhat. Personally, it's a toss-up between both. I'd go with either. Now, we move on to the deluxe-level riders. The math behind the $38,500 figure Let \\(T\\) be the total hospital bill size and \\(D_{max}\\) be the maximum advertised deductible. The actual deductible paid is given as \\[\\begin{equation} min(T, D_{max}) \\end{equation}\\] For GE TotalCare Classic, the amount one would co-pay if they saw a non-panel doctor is the greater of the maximum deductible or 5% of the total bill, or: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{copay_ge} Copay_{GE} = max(min(T, D_{max}), 0.05\\cdot T) \\end{equation}\\] For PRUExtra Premier Lite CoPay, one pays 50% of the deductible, followed by 50% of the coinsurance (10% of the amount remaining after the maximum deductible is subtracted). \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{deductible} \\text{50% of deductible} = 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{coinsurance} \\text{50% of coinsurance} = 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\end{equation}\\] since there is no co-insurance to pay if the total bill is less than the maximum deductible. By adding eqn. \\(\\ref{deductible}\\) and \\(\\ref{coinsurance}\\) we obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{copay_pru} Copay_{Prudential} = 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) + 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\end{equation}\\] Subtracting eqn. \\(\\ref{copay_ge}\\) from \\(\\ref{copay_pru}\\) , we obtain \\(\\Delta_{Prudential - GE}\\) , or the extra amount one would pay with Prudential versus GE: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{delta} \\begin{split} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE} &= Copay_{Prudential} - Copay_{GE} \\nonumber \\\\ &= 0.5\\cdot min(T, D_{max}) + 0.05\\cdot max(T - D_{max}, 0) \\\\ &\\quad- max(min(T, D_{max}), 0.05\\cdot T) \\end{split} \\end{equation}\\] If \\(\\Delta_{Prudential - GE} \\geq 0\\) , one would pay more for the Prudential plan, given a total bill size \\(T\\) . We simplify eqn. \\(\\ref{delta}\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{cases} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE}= \\begin{cases} -0.5\\cdot T,& \\text{if } T \\leq D_{max} \\\\ 0.05\\cdot T - 0.55\\cdot D_{max}, & \\text{if } T \\gt D_{max} \\text{ and } T \\lt 20\\cdot D_{max} \\\\ 0.45\\cdot D_{max} & \\text{if } T \\geq 20\\cdot D_{max} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Note that for the second case: \\[\\begin{equation} 0.05\\cdot T - 0.55\\cdot D_{max} \\gt 0 \\text{ when } T \\gt 11\\cdot D_{max} \\end{equation}\\] We can conclude that one would pay more for the Prudential plan when \\(T \\gt 11\\cdot D_{max}\\) . When \\(T \\lt 11\\cdot D_{max}\\) , one would pay less with the Prudential plan. Finally, for our case \\(D_{max} = 3500\\) , we obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{cases-3500} \\Delta_{Prudential - GE}= \\begin{cases} -0.5\\cdot T,& \\text{if } T \\leq 3500 \\\\ 0.05\\cdot T - 1925, & \\text{if } T \\gt 3500 \\text{ and } T \\lt 70000 \\\\ 1575 & \\text{if } T \\geq 20\\cdot D_{max} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] Visually, Eqn. \\(\\ref{cases-3500}\\) can be plotted as follows:","title":"Which is the best classic-level rider?"},{"location":"posts/insurance/2021-06-19-comparison-of-isp-riders/#which-is-the-best-deluxe-level-rider","text":"All 3 insurers here offer 5% co-payment riders here (although Prudential's PRUExtra Premier has an additional 5% of deductible). Of note, only NTUC does not explictly mention claims-based pricing. However, there is an 'additional non-panel payment' which is unspecified . I consider this a form of claims-based pricing. The actual penalty is unknown, and for this reason NTUC is out of the picture again. Prudential's claims-based pricing penalty is the most severe, with a 3x premium penalty if you claim more than $5000 from a non-panel provider. GE's penalty is 1.5x the premium as penalty if you claim more than $2000 for the first time. It increases up to 2.5x the premium subsequently. We now look at other factors. Of the three, Prudential has the longest pre- and post- hospitalization coverage of 180 and 365 days respectively. This is longer than GE's 120/180 days. GE has a nice 'home health care' benefit which I've mentioned above . I'd favour Prudential somewhat here, since the idea is to get as much coverage as possible for the deluxe-level rider.","title":"Which is the best deluxe-level rider?"},{"location":"posts/insurance/2021-06-19-comparison-of-isp-riders/#conclusion","text":"It's a bit of a surprise to me (as I'm on a GE plan currently). The Prudential riders (specifically the PRUExtra Premier Lite and Premier) stand out above the rest, if only lightly.

For example, you might take the probability of hospitalization at each year of life, multiply that by the median hospital bill size, and sum till different ages. The age at which the total costs of the deluxe-level rider begins to exceed the sum of the hospital bills is where one might decide to downgrade. This however, ignores the fact that the probability of hospitalization each year is not independent. Being hospitalized once a year, consecutively for 5 years in a row, might mean you have some condition necessitating much more frequent hospitalizations than the base probabilities suggest.
